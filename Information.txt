Professional Approach se humne yeh structure bnaya hai

Question => Why we have made .end.sample file ==> Just to give third person a reference

We made few changes to the package.json file
1) "type": "module" ==> We will be using import module syntax
2) "dev": "nodemon src/index.js" ==> For starting the server using simple command

Question => Why we are using prettier package?
Because when you work with a team then it may happen that different people are comfortable to different indentation or different formatting,etc. To keep things simple, we will uniform things by using prettier package.

We are connecting the mongodb cloud database (Atlas).

Take care of these things while taking to the database
  1) Use try and catch block to interact with the database because it may happed that you have to handle errors.
  2) Use async and await because you should always assume that taking to the database takes time.

We try to load environment variables as soon as possible so that they will be available to each file, Remember to load them in the very first file that will be executed when you application will run

It is always a good practice to print errors to the console, you will get idea to debugg them.

Whenever you modify the environment variables you have to restart the server manually, nodemon will not be able to help you.
